## Examples

## API

#### `export default` `Popover(props, target)`

##### `props : {...}`

- `body`: Content for `popover` that becomes children of `Popover-body`. Therefore can be a single element or an array of elements.
- `isOpen`: Determines Whether or not the popover is rendered.
- `className`, `style`

##### `target : React Element`

- The React Element that this popover will orient itself around. `target` rendering tree is unaffected. `Popover` will simply become its `owner`.
